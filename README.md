# Image Filtering and Classification with ResNet-50 and Transfer Learning :rocket: ðŸš€

## Project Overview

This project implements an image classification pipeline using the ResNet-50 architecture with transfer learning. It also includes image filtering techniques to preprocess and enhance images before classification. The goal is to build a robust model that can classify images into predefined categories with high accuracy.

## Features

- **Image Filtering:** Preprocessing with techniques such as Gaussian filtering and image denoising.
- **Transfer Learning:** Fine-tuning a pre-trained ResNet-50 model on a custom dataset.
- **Model Training:** Training the model with custom data and evaluating its performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

```

# Setup and Installation

## Clone the Repository:

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NanGyeThote/PictoNet.git
cd PictoNet
```

## Prepare Your Dataset

Ensure your dataset is organized in the following structure:

```bash
data/
    train/
        cat/img1.jpg
        dog/img1.jpg
        horse/img1.jpg
    val/
        cat/img2.jpg
        dog/img2.jpg
        horse/img2.jpg
```

## Run the Filtering and Classification Script

Execute the following command to run the filtering and classification script:

```bash
python main.py
```
Make sure to update the dataset paths and any configuration settings as needed in the config.py file before running the script.

## Usage

1. **Filtering Images**:

    * The filtering script applies techniques like Gaussian filtering and denoising.
    * The filtered images are saved to a specified directory.

2. **Training the Model**:

    * The training script uses transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet-50 model.
    * Modify the hyperparameters and paths as needed in the config.py file.

3. **Evaluating the Model**:

    * After training, the model is evaluated on the validation set.
    * Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) are reported.

```python

    elif method == 'Bilateral Filter':
        # PIL does not support bilateral filtering; use Gaussian Blur as an alternative
        filtered_image = image.filter(ImageFilter.GaussianBlur(radius=2))
    else:
        filtered_image = image
    
    return filtered_image

        output = model(input_tensor)
    _, predicted = torch.max(output, 1)
    return predicted.item()

        # About This App

        This Streamlit app allows you to upload an image, apply various denoising methods, 
        and classify the denoised image using a pre-trained ResNet model. You can choose from 
        Gaussian Blur, Median Filtering, or Bilateral Filtering to denoise the image before 
        performing classification.

        **Denoising Methods:**
        - **Gaussian Blur:** Applies a Gaussian filter to reduce noise.
        - **Median Filtering:** Replaces each pixel with the median of neighboring pixels.
        - **Bilateral Filtering:** (Placeholder) Uses Gaussian blur as a proxy.

        **Classification:**
        The denoised image is classified using a ResNet-50 model trained on the ImageNet dataset.
        But **Please upload images within the classes of animals and clothes. Otherwise the dataset may be out of ranges.**

        **How to Use:**
        1. Upload an image.
        2. Select a denoising method.
        3. View the denoised image and classification results.
